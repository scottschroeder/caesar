# Caesar Cipher

This is a toy project to get familiar with rust, and rust tooling.

_Note: this is actually the Vigen√®re cipher_

## Requirements/Goals
* Encrypt/Decrypt plaintext into/from ciphertext
  * Support for multiple encodings
* Perform frequency analysis to break ciphertext
* Unix-like CLI
* Logging
* Complete Documentation
* Test coverage where appropriate

## Current Status

* Very basic encrypt/decrypt working.
  * Only operates on `a-zA-Z`
